# TEXTIFY: CNN from scratch
This is a project to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal of this project is to understand the inner workings of CNNs and to appreciate the complexity of the libraries that we use to build them. 

## Dataset Used:
EMNIST dataset is used for this project. The dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19 and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset.

### Downloading the dataset:
You can download the dataset from the following link: [EMNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist).

Unzip the dataset and place the contents in 'data/' directory.

## For `test-version` Branch:
You can run `forward.py` and `backward.py` files to test the forward and backward pass of the CNN. There are extra print statements in the code to help you understand the flow of the code. (This will be removed in the `main` branch)
